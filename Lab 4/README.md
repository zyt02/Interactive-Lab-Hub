### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 2 ways you can do so:

Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.
```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2025
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

Option 3: (preferred) use the Github.com interface to update the changes.

### Start brainstorming ideas by reading: 

* [What do prototypes prototype?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-do-Prototypes-Prototype-Houde-Hill/30bc6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149)
* [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs. 
* [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit. 
* [Tips to Cut, Fold, Mold and Papier-Mache Cardboard](https://makezine.com/2016/04/21/working-with-cardboard-tips-cut-fold-mold-papier-mache/) from Make Magazine.
* [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard.  The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change. 
* [Dyson Vacuum Cardboard Prototypes](http://media.dyson.com/downloads/JDF/JDF_Prim_poster05.pdf)

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
</p>

<details>
	<summary><strong>Instructions(Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). Install the latest requirements from your working virtual environment:

These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py 
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

#### Rotary Encoder 

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came with separate breakout board and encoder itself, that is, they will need to be soldered if you have not yet done so! We will be bringing the soldering station to the lab class for you to use, also, you can go to the MakerLAB to do the soldering off-class. Here is some [guidance on soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation) from Adafruit. When you first solder, get someone who has done it before (ideally in the MakerLAB environment). It is a good idea to review this material beforehand so you know what to look at.

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing

Usually, sensors need to be positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it.

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

#### 1. Bedside Sleep Companion
> Nightstand device for bedroom

<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyyKwdragx.png" height="500"/>

```
Proximity: Detects when you reach over → displays time
Gesture up: Snooze alarm
Gesture down: Dismiss alarm
Light sensor: Auto-adjusts display brightness (dim at night, bright in morning)
Color sensor: Could detect sunrise colors and wake you gently
```

- Questions Raised:
    - Accidental triggers: Does rolling over in bed, pets, or a partner reaching over cause false alarms?
    - Gesture direction matters?: In darkness, do users naturally swipe up vs down? Or do they just wave randomly?
    - Sunrise color detection reliability: Can the sensor distinguish between actual sunrise, car headlights, phone screens, or artificial lights?
    - Optimal mounting position: Nightstand height? Angled down toward the bed or straight up?

- Need to Prototype:
    - Test with actual sleepy people
    - Mount device at different nightstand positions and observe natural reach patterns
    - Test color sensor with various light sources at dawn to see if sunrise is distinguishable

#### 2. Invisible DJ Booth

> Music playback controller!

<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ7rUOSTee.png" height="500"/>
How it works:
```
Swipe left/right: Skip tracks (prev/next song)
Swipe up/down: Volume control
Proximity + hold hand close: Scrub through current song (closer = faster scrub)
Color detection: Place colored cards near sensor to switch playlists (red=energetic, blue=chill, etc.)
Gesture combos: Double swipe for shuffle, circular motion for repeat
```

- Questions Raised:
    - Do users naturally gesture horizontally over a flat surface, or do they lift their hands up?
    - Color card distance: How close must colored cards be to the sensor? Does ambient lighting affect color detection?


Need to Prototype:

- Flat deck surface with sensor in center, test optimal hand hovering height (5cm? 10cm? 15cm?)
- Test color detection with different lighting conditions (bright room, dim room, colored room lights)
- Test if users can scrub through a song without visual feedback initially

#### 3. Interactive Tamagotchi

> Handheld-sized digit-pet
 
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByHJruHpxx.png" height="500"/>

```
Gesture Interactions:🍖 Swipe UP = Feed pet

Increases hunger bar
Pet does happy animation
Too much = sick!
🎮 Swipe DOWN = Play with pet

Pet jumps/bounces animation
Increases happiness
Decreases hunger slightly (exercise!)
❤️ Swipe RIGHT = Pet/affection

Pet purrs/wags tail
Increases happiness
Builds bond level
💊 Swipe LEFT = Give medicine/clean

Cures sickness
Cleans up "mess"
Returns to healthy state
👋 Proximity detection = Check status/wake up
```

- Questions Raised:
    - False positives: How often does normal movement (walking, putting it in a pocket) trigger unintended actions?
    - Hand positioning: Do users naturally gesture over the sensor, or do they gesture in front of the screen?

- Need to Prototype:
    - An egg-shaped enclosure with the ADPS sensor mounted at different positions (top, front, angled)
    - Test different gesture heights (2cm, 5cm, 10cm above sensor)
    - Observe natural user behavior: where do people instinctively gesture?

#### 4. Bathroom Hand-Wash Timer

> Educational handwash timer, perfect for k-12!

 
<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1AlO_Haxl.png" height="500"/>

```
Proximity: Detects when hands are under sensor → starts 20-second countdown
Display: Shows countdown timer with progress bar
Gesture up: Restart timer if you need more time
Ambient light: Works in dark bathrooms (auto-brightness)
Feedback: Beeps/flashes when 20 seconds complete (proper hand-washing time)
```

- Questions Raised:
    - Water interference: Does running water, steam, or soap splashes affect the sensor?
    - Mounting height: What's optimal - mounted high looking down, or at counter level?
    - Edge case behaviors: What if you move hands in/out of range while washing? Does timer pause or restart?

- Need to Prototype:
    - Mount sensor above actual sink, test with running water and steam
    - Test detection cone width - can it cover the entire sink area?
    - Test with different hand movements (vigorous scrubbing, gentle washing)


#### 5. "Medicine Reminder Box"
> Physical reminder for taking pills/vitamins, perfect for elders!

<img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1ID9Orpxl.png" height="500"/>

```
Display: Shows "TIME TO TAKE MEDS" at scheduled times
Proximity: Wave hand to confirm you took medicine → logs timestamp
Gesture up: Snooze reminder for 10 minutes
Gesture down: Mark as "skipped" (records missed dose)
Ambient light: Tracks if you're home when reminder goes off (lights on = home)
Color sensor: Could detect pill bottle colors to track which medication
```

- Questions Raised:
    - How does it distinguish between "wave to confirm" vs "reaching for pills" vs "just passing by"?
    - Color detection practical range: Must pill bottles be placed at exact distance? Does bottle shape/label affect detection?
    - What if someone waves at the device accidentally while moving around the room?

- Need to Prototype:
    - Test with actual elderly users and observe natural gesture patterns and difficulties
    - Test color detection with real pill bottles at various distances and angles
    - Test ambient light sensor correlation with "home presence" over several days


### Part D

<details>
	<summary><strong>Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts (Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

Here is a Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display interface:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

This is fine, but the mounting of the display constrains the display location and orientation a lot. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibly mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />

</p>

It holds a Pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z  depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box  | Z  depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>* * * * * (don't make this too short) * * * * *</sup></sub>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back. 

Here is an example:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/horoscope.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Think about how you want to present the information about what your sensor is sensing! Design a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.

# LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.



### Part E

#### Chaining Devices and Exploring Interaction Effects

For Part 2, you will design and build a fun interactive prototype using multiple inputs and outputs. This means chaining Qwiic and STEMMA QT devices (e.g., buttons, encoders, sensors, servos, displays) and/or combining with traditional breadboard prototyping (e.g., LEDs, buzzers, etc.).

**Your prototype should:**
- Combine at least two different types of input and output devices, inspired by your physical considerations from Part 1.
- Be playful, creative, and demonstrate multi-input/multi-output interaction.

**Document your system with:**
- Code for your multi-device demo
- Photos and/or video of the working prototype in action
- A simple interaction diagram or sketch showing how inputs and outputs are connected and interact
- Written reflection: What did you learn about multi-input/multi-output interaction? What was fun, surprising, or challenging?

**Questions to consider:**
- What new types of interaction become possible when you combine two or more sensors or actuators?
- How does the physical arrangement of devices (e.g., where the encoder or sensor is placed) change the user experience?
- What happens if you use one device to control or modulate another (e.g., encoder sets a threshold, sensor triggers an action)?
- How does the system feel if you swap which device is "primary" and which is "secondary"?

Try chaining different combinations and document what you discover!

See encoder_accel_servo_dashboard.py in the Lab 4 folder for an example of chaining together three devices.

##### Using Multiple Qwiic Buttons: Changing I2C Address (Physically & Digitally)

If you want to use more than one Qwiic Button in your project, you must give each button a unique I2C address. There are two ways to do this:

##### 1. Physically: Soldering Address Jumpers

On the back of the Qwiic Button, you'll find four solder jumpers labeled A0, A1, A2, and A3. By bridging these with solder, you change the I2C address. Only one button on the chain can use the default address (0x6F).

**Address Table:**

| A3 | A2 | A1 | A0 | Address (hex) |
|----|----|----|----|---------------|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x6F       |
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |    0x6E       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |    0x6D       |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |    0x6C       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |    0x6B       |
|  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |    0x6A       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |    0x69       |
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |    0x68       |
|  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |    0x67       |
| ...| ...| ...| ... |     ...      |

For example, if you solder A0 closed (leave A1, A2, A3 open), the address becomes 0x6E.

**Soldering Tips:**
- Use a small amount of solder to bridge the pads for the jumper you want to close.
- Only one jumper needs to be closed for each address change (see table above).
- Power cycle the button after changing the jumper.

##### 2. Digitally: Using Software to Change Address

You can also change the address in software (temporarily or permanently) using the example script `qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py` in the Lab 4 folder. This is useful if you want to reassign addresses without soldering.

Run the script and follow the prompts:
```bash
python qwiic_button_ex6_changeI2CAddress.py
```
Enter the new address (e.g., 5B for 0x5B) when prompted. Power cycle the button after changing the address.

**Note:** The software method is less foolproof and you need to make sure to keep track of which button has which address!

##### Using Multiple Buttons in Code

After setting unique addresses, you can use multiple buttons in your script. See these example scripts in the Lab 4 folder:

- **`qwiic_1_button.py`**: Basic example for reading a single Qwiic Button (default address 0x6F). Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_1_button.py
	```

- **`qwiic_button_led_demo.py`**: Demonstrates using two Qwiic Buttons at different addresses (e.g., 0x6F and 0x6E) and controlling their LEDs. Button 1 toggles its own LED; Button 2 toggles both LEDs. Run with:
	```bash
	python qwiic_button_led_demo.py
	```

Here is a minimal code example for two buttons:
```python
import qwiic_button

# Default button (0x6F)
button1 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton()
# Button with A0 soldered (0x6E)
button2 = qwiic_button.QwiicButton(0x6E)

button1.begin()
button2.begin()

while True:
		if button1.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 1 pressed!")
		if button2.is_button_pressed():
				print("Button 2 pressed!")
```

### PCF8574 GPIO Expander: Add More Pins Over I²C

Sometimes your Pi’s header GPIO pins are already full (e.g., with a display or HAT). That’s where an I²C GPIO expander comes in handy.

We use the Adafruit PCF8574 I²C GPIO Expander, which gives you 8 extra digital pins over I²C. It’s a great way to prototype with LEDs, buttons, or other components on the breadboard without worrying about pin conflicts—similar to how Arduino users often expand their pinouts when prototyping physical interactions.

**Why is this useful?**
- You only need two wires (I²C: SDA + SCL) to unlock 8 extra GPIOs.
- It integrates smoothly with CircuitPython and Blinka.
- It allows a clean prototyping workflow when the Pi’s 40-pin header is already occupied by displays, HATs, or sensors.
- Makes breadboard setups feel more like an Arduino-style prototyping environment where it’s easy to wire up interaction elements.

**Demo Script:** `Lab 4/gpio_expander.py`

<p align="center">
    <img src="gpio_leds.gif" alt="GPIO Expander LED Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

We connected 8 LEDs (through 220 Ω resistors) to the expander and ran a little light show. The script cycles through three patterns:
- Chase (one LED at a time, left to right)
- Knight Rider (back-and-forth sweep)
- Disco (random blink chaos)

Every few runs, the script swaps to the next pattern automatically:
```bash
python gpio_expander.py
```

This is a playful way to visualize how the expander works, but the same technique applies if you wanted to prototype buttons, switches, or other interaction elements. It’s a lightweight, flexible addition to your prototyping toolkit.

### Servo Control with SparkFun Servo pHAT
For this lab, you will use the **SparkFun Servo pHAT** to control a micro servo (such as the Miuzei MS18 or similar 9g servo). The Servo pHAT stacks directly on top of the Adafruit Mini PiTFT (135×240) display without pin conflicts:
- The Mini PiTFT uses SPI (GPIO22, 23, 24, 25) for display and buttons ([SPI pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/spi)).
- The Servo pHAT uses I²C (GPIO2 & 3) for the PCA9685 servo driver ([I2C pinout](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c)).
- Since SPI and I²C are separate buses, you can use both boards together.
**⚡ Power:**
- Plug a USB-C cable into the Servo pHAT to provide enough current for the servos. The Pi itself should still be powered by its own USB-C supply. Do NOT power servos from the Pi’s 5V rail.

<p align="center">
    <img src="Servo_pHAT.gif" alt="Servo pHAT Demo" width="400"/>
</p>

**Basic Python Example:**
We provide a simple example script: `Lab 4/pi_servo_hat_test.py` (requires the `pi_servo_hat` Python package).
Run the example:
```
python pi_servo_hat_test.py
```
For more details and advanced usage, see the [official SparkFun Servo pHAT documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pi-servo-phat-v2-hookup-guide/all#resources-and-going-further).
A servo motor is a rotary actuator that allows for precise control of angular position. The position is set by the width of an electrical pulse (PWM). You can read [this Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn more about how servos work.

#### Interaction Design & Reflections

##### 1. Interaction Complexity & Systems
> Key Insight: 1 + 1 > 2

Multi-input systems aren't just "more inputs" — they create a multiplication effect where interactions become richer than the sum of their parts. When we combined feeding (joystick) with petting (gesture), it created a "moment" that cannot be accomplished by either one action.


Precise control (joystick navigation) + Spontaneous motion (gesture petting) ->  Emergent complexity

Example from our prototype:
Joystick Feed alone      = Dog eats (functional)
Gesture Pet alone        = Dog feels loved (emotional)
BOTH together            = Hand-feeding moment (intimate bonding)

##### 2. How Emotions Are Created
> Learned interactions, with proper rewarding mechanism, feel more natural and intuitive.

After talking to users, we learned there's a high correlation between motivation/attachment in gameplay when there are more than one outputs involved. Simultaneous outputs make the interactions feel more **real**. Especially when there are more than one senses engaged (visual + audio). That is why we decided to use an audio output.

##### 3. Managing Input Conflicts
> Figure out what takes precedence is more important than we thought - it defines the system and the expected interaction.

What happens when someone tries to pet and it tricked the light sensor into thinking it's night time? 

**Short answer: iterations of feature design.** 

We decided to redesign the gesture that will trigger a petting action, that will be compatible with the capability of the sen

### Part F

### Record
Document all the prototypes and iterations you have designed and worked on! Again, deliverables for this lab are writings, sketches, photos, and videos that show what your prototype:
* "Looks like": shows how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
* "Works like": shows what the device can do
* "Acts like": shows how a person would interact with the device

#### screen prototypes - [looks like]

> We want the device to look like a Tamagotchi, a traditional digital pet toy device.
> Therefore, the screen design will feature a comic-like dog instead of a tech/realistic pet.
> We chose Corgi because that's usually a dog that captures people's attention and they're really cute!

- left: default screen the user will see without giving any interaction. There's also a scoreboard that nudges user to interact with the pet
- right: interaction/response from the pet, along with '+1 :heart:' event effect
